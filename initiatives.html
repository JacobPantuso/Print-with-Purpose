                            <li>Ethical sourcing is the process of prioritizing materials from responsibly managed forests and suppliers with ethical labour practices.</li>
                            <li>Using paper made from recycled materials to reduce reliance on non-renewable resources and minimize waste.</li>
                            <li>Explore alternatives such as hemp, bamboo, sugarcane, and reclaimed straw for paper production.</li>
                            <li>Using responsibly sourced inks that are not harmful to the environment to be disposed of (GelatoConnect, 2024).</li>

                            <li>Tracking print usage can help spot patterns in operations where excessive or unnecessary printing is occurring.</li>
                            <li>Eco-friendly inks, such as vegetable or soy-based inks, are more biodegradable compared to traditional inks.</li>
                            <li>Opting for recycled paper contributes to waste reduction and the conservation of our forests.</li>
                            <li>Previously iterated, double-sided printing can drastically cut paper waste by 50% (GelatoConnect, 2024).</li>

                            <li>Reducing the reliance on hard copy proofs can provide a significant decrease in paper usage. Digital proofs are cost-effective and environmentally friendly.</li>
                            <li>By adopting efficient print-management software, organizations can effectively reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing operations.</li>
                            <li>Companies can optimize their inventories by only stocking materials that are necessary; this solution is often achieved with state-of-the-art software.</li>
                            <li>The implementation of real-time analytics can also help organizations save energy. Not only is this better for the environment, it reduces the cost of energy delivery bills (GelatoConnect, 2024).</li>

                <p>
                    While it is only fair that the largest printing companies take the most responsibility, it is also important to note that smaller companies can make a difference too. In addition to smaller companies,
                    individuals can also make a difference by reducing their own printing. The average person prints 7,000 pages per year, which is equivalent to 1.5 trees (Nestor, 2024). If everyone reduced their printing by 50%, we could save 1.5 million trees per year! (Nestor, 2024).

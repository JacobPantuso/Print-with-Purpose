                <h1>Sustainability Successes in the Printing Industry.</h1>
                <p>
                    Protecting the environment is a major concern for the printing industry. The industry has been making strides in adopting sustainable practices, such as using eco-friendly inks, recycling paper, and reducing energy consumption. These efforts not only help preserve natural resources but also contribute to a greener future. This
                    page will walk you through some of the successes achieved by the printing industry and what more can be done.

                    A common misconception in the printing industry is that the paper used is sourced from natural, historic forests. In reality,
                    the majority of paper is sourced from sustainably managed forests. These forests are specifically planted and harvested for the purpose of producing paper, ensuring that the natural ecosystem is preserved and that the trees are replanted after harvesting (Walsworth, 2024).

                        <p>
                            The printing industry has gone through many evolutions to be in the position it is today (Drupa, 2024).
                            Environmentally friendly options already exist for <b>paper and printing inks</b>. These options continue
                            to pave the way away from traditional methods that are harmful to the environment.

                        <p>
                            Over recent years, more companies have begun to incorporate sustainable packaging options into their products or services. Companies like Apple (2025) have already converted 97% of packaging to fibre-based products. In addition, the removal of plastic and incorporation of recycled materials will help strengthen the impact.

                        <p>
                            The printing industry has made significant progress in reducing its effects on the environment. The World Shipping Council (2025) indicates that the maritime shipping industry, which plays a critical role in global trade, has made notable strides in minimizing its environmental impact. Sulphur emissions have been reduced to 0.5% from the previous high of 3.5%, and additionally, the industry is on track to see a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (World Shipping Council, 2025).

                <p>
                    The printing industry has already made significant strides in reducing its environmental impact, but there is still much more to be done. The industry should continue to invest in carbon-netural shipping solutions, cut-back on wasting resources, and investing in eco-friendly printing solutions.

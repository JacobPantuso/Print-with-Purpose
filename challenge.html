                <h1>Sustainability Challenges in the Printing Industry.</h1>
                <p>
                    Although printing is inherently unsustainable, businesses and organizations can be encouraged to reduce their printing or adopt more innovative practices. 
                    Since achieving 100% sustainability in printing isn’t feasible yet, shouldn’t we at least strive to make it <i>more</i> sustainable? (Nestor, 2024)

                        <h3>Environmental Impact of Paper Waste</h3>
                        <p>
                            It’s important to consider the carbon footprint of printing. Printing does not just include the paper itself. It also includes the machines, the manufacturing process, the inks and toners, the e-waste, the energy needed, and ending at the disposal of materials. All of these factors combined can place large strains on our environmental progress. Detailed statistics show that a single A4 96-page, litho-printed colour brochure with a run of 20,000 copies creates a carbon footprint of about 20 tons (CO2e). That’s equivalent to flying around the world four times (Nestor, 2024)!!

                        <h3>Unsustainable Printing</h3>
                        <p>
                            Unsustainable printing is the act of printing more than you need to, or in simple words, printing inefficiently. Many organizations can actually save tons of money by switching to more sustainable printing practices. Double-sided printing, for example, reduces paper consumption by up to 50%.  Additionally, refilling ink cartridges instead of purchasing new ones can cut costs by 50% and help prevent waste from ending up in landfills (Nestor, 2024).                        </p>

                        <h3>Recycling and Re-Using Print Materials</h3>
                        <p>
                            As mentioned previously, the most sustainable printing practice is to print less. Organizations that produce large amounts of paper waste should prioritize recycling, as paper accounts for over half of all recycled materials. Improper disposal of paper waste can have a significant negative impact on the environment (Nestor, 2024). By purchasing recycled paper and reducing paper waste we can greatly reduce our impacts on the environment.

                <h1>What is Carbon Footprint?</h1>
                <p>
                    Carbon footprint quantifies the environmental impact of everyday actions. It measures the primary and secondary emissions associated with a person or an entity that are released into the atmosphere. Many external factors can contribute to a high carbon footprint, but one of them is deforestation, which is closely linked with the printing industry. When trees are cut down, stored carbon is released as C02, accelerating climate change. This underscores the importance of recycling and re-using materials as essential practices to mitigate the harmful effects of carbon emissions on our atmosphere (FSC, 2024)                </p>
